# Smart-Car-Parking-System

The parking system faces many problems in the parking environment. In order, to
solve those problems, smart parking systems have been developed. Various
approaches and researches are made to overcome the difficulties of parking areas.
As a result, many systems and technologies are made for parking. The car parking
system is now a smart system which is designed by using various technologies and
advanced researches. It is implemented in many environments with various features,
which solves their problems faced in their day to day activities. The System
architecture was guided by the principle of tiered functionality. There are three
tiered functionalities, the lowest level comprising of the sensing functionality, a
middle tier dealing with data the forwarding, and the upper tier handling data
storage, processing and client interfaces.
The smart parking system that we propose has been developed for checking if the
parking slots are available or not. If the slots are free, cars can be parked in those
areas. Because of the proper allocation, various problems of the parking spaces can
be solved. It also saves the time of the customers. Some systems are payment system,
where the collection is made automatically. For finding if the parking slots are free
or not, we have used piezoelectric sensors. Although optical and electrochemical
transducers are the two most popular transducers but piezoelectric transducers have
also gained some popularity in the past couple of decades. Like optical and
electrochemical transducers, piezoelectric transducers can be used as physical
sensors. We can also use other sensors like IR sensors, ultrasonic sensors etc. for
making a smart car parking system but we have used piezoelectric sensors because
they are very cost efficient. This project is aimed to develop a cost efficient, easy to
use system for the users to prevent such a chaos in the parking areas.
