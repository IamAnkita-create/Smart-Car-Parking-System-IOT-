The smart parking system consists of one a servo motor that operates as the gate (entry/exit) to the smart parking system. This gates functioning depends on the 2 IR sensors that are placed near it which detects if there is a vehicle at the moment or not and then operates accordingly. The free slots for the parking are detected based on pressure changes that occur on the plate. If the change in pressure is greater than a certain threshold then the parking status is switched.
